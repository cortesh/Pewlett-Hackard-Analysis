# Overview of the analysis: 
## Preparing for the "Silver Tsunami"

Pewlett Hackard is a well established company with thousands of employees in business for decades.  Recently leadership has mandated a proactive approach to forecast employee retirement trends in order to prepare to:
1.  provide retirement packages for its employees and
2.  fill in positions in anticipation of this retirement wave

## Project Requirements:
 * determine the number of retiring employees per title, and 
 * identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

# Results: 
* 90,398 out of 300,024 total employees which amounts to 1 in 3 employees is slated to retire soon, underscoring the urgency of this study.

* Our study shows that the greatest urgency lies in the most senior ranks (Senior Engineer 29,414 and Senior Staff 28,254 making up 64% of the total retirement pool).  As such the mentor program is vital to elevating the next generations of leaders in anticipation to the loss of this institutional talent and accumulated knowledge.
* the size of the mentor program is insufficient to meet the training and replacement demands (1,549 mentorees or just 17% of the retirement pool).
* a deeper dive into the mentor pool shows that senior engineer title is in particular risk with only 169 mentorees holding that title (this represents only 0.6% of the retiring class!)

# Summary: Main Takeaways:

* a total 90,398 employees are reaching or of age to retire
* only 1,549 employees between the ages of 55 (born in 1965) who are experienced enough to take over the top rungs of the company.

However, if you adjust the birth date range by 5 years, from 1960-1965 (instead of only 1965), you can generate a mentoree pool of 93,756 or 104% of the retiring class!  This would give Pewlett Hackard more than enough up-and-coming leaders.  Nevertheless, it is clear that Pewlett Hackard's employee pool skews heavily towards an older demographic which on the one hand implies that it is a good place to work, where most choose to live out their careers there, but that too little investment is made in bringing in and cultivating young talent.
